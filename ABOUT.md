I choose the Java Web Applocation because I have excperiance in Mobile java develoment.

 what you wanted to accomplish with your application??
I want to create simple web site using the Java language in MVC pattern,used TomCat server
I wanted to create the web site dynamically as asked in the assignment, Viewing the JSON object in Table with the ability to make dynamic filter on the result.

Include your thought process as you built the application
- Add Home Controller to load the Hole hotel list as a default when the Web site loads
- Create SelectLiquorServlet to make the server side dynamic call
- Add Util Class where the Shared functions exist so will be reachable from the HomeController and from the SelectLiquorServlet.
- Used gson lib to serialize the consumned gson string from the Url
- Used jsp to view the API result

 what you learned in the process
I learned many and many thing while during my 11 years experiance in development field this is the first web site I had created I didn't try before because all my experiance in the desktop applications and the mobile development  java, and javasript, SO it was challange for me to do this simple assignmet and I will thank you because you help me to make it.

I learne how to prepare the web environment, make API from the server side,link the java and html in jsp file with each others and how to deploy the web site.
